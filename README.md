# Stock-Market-Portfolio-Optimization
Stock market portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best combination of stocks to maximize returns while minimizing the risk, based on historical performance data and financial metrics.
Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to stock market portfolio optimization using Python. The goal is to analyze stock price trends, calculate expected returns and volatilities, and determine correlations between different stocks to achieve optimal diversification. The project leverages Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to construct an efficient portfolio that represents the optimal trade-off between risk and return.

# Getting Started

Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need to install the required Python libraries.

## Collecting Stock Market Data

We use the yfinance API to collect real-time stock market data. The yfinance library is a convenient tool to fetch historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.

## Key Components

Data Collection: Fetch historical stock data using the yfinance API.

Data Analysis: Compute returns, volatilities, and correlations.

Optimization: Apply Modern Portfolio Theory to find the efficient frontier and optimal portfolio.
